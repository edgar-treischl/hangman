# 🕹️ Hangman (CLI)

A simple **command-line Hangman game** written in Python.

This project was created as a **learning exercise for kids** (and beginners) to practice:
- Python basics
- Loops and conditionals
- Functions
- Working with strings
- Running programs from the terminal

## 🎯 How It Works
- The player guesses one letter at a time
- Correct guesses reveal letters in the word
- Wrong guesses reduce the number of attempts
- The game ends when the word is guessed or attempts run out

## ▶️ How to Run

```bash
python main.py
```
